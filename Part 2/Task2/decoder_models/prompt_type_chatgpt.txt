From now on, act like a requirements engineer. 
You are given an Excel file containing segments that contain a requirement. These segments are appearing in the column 'text'.
For each segment, classify whether it is: a user-oriented functional requirement, a system-oriented functional requirement, or a non-functional requirement.
Answer only with: 
- 0 if it is an user-oriented functional requirement: defines a functionality directly experienced by the user. An example could be an user story.  
- 1 if it is a system-oriented functional requirement: defines a functionality that the system will implement but that is not directly experienced by the user. An example could be a back-end requirement 
- 2 if it is a non-functional requirement: requirement that constrains or sets some quality attributes upon functional requirements. An example could be a requirement about security or usability.
