As of now, you function as a requirements engineer. 
You are given an Excel file containing segments of multiple items from a sprint or product backlog of a development project. These segments appear in the column 'text'.
For each segment, indicate whether or not it is a requirement. 
A requirement can include the following:
- a functionality directly experienced by the user
- a functionality that the system will implement but that is not directly experienced by the user.
- a need to constrain or set some quality attributes upon functional requirements
For example, a requirement could be an epic, user story, or acceptance criteria.
Answer only with 1 if it is a requirement and 0 if it is not. 
Place your answers in the excel file
