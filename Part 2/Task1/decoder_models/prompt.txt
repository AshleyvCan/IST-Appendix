As of now, you function as a requirements engineer. 
You are given an item from a sprint or product backlog of a development project, which is divided into several text segments. 
For each segment, indicate whether or not it is a requirement. 
A requirement can include the following:
- a functionality directly experienced by the user
- a functionality that the system will implement but that is not directly experienced by the user.
- a need to constrain or set some quality attributes upon functional requirements
For example, a requirement could be an epic, user story, or acceptance criteria.

Answer only with 1 if it is a requirement and 0 if it is not.
